<h2>Jiva is a Miva Script / Javascript Framework</h2>

The purpose of this framework is to allow a better and bug-free programming of web applications. Knowledge of Miva Script is a must but knowledge of Javascript is optional, unless you want to develop new core objects.

<h2>How this works</h2>

MivaScript is server side and Javascript is client side. So, basically, the main page is created by Mivascript and the rest of the actions on the page are done by Javascript (to make it easier, we work with JQuery). So, this way, we can provide an interactive level on the page after it is loaded - or even before - (things that we could not do only with Mivascript as the file needs to be read and executed by Empresa in order to show the content to the browser). Now with Jiva we can specify actions before and after the page was loaded.

<h2>What is Jiva Desktop</h2>

It's a webdesktop application that was created in order to give non-advanced users a good start in using and creating apps with Jiva. It has it's own plugin system and apps system.

<h2>What can I do with Jiva Desktop</h2>

Well, lot of things. Develop new applications and share it with the community, only use the apps. A bunch of core apps are already created - like JivaMail, JivaWord, JivaPaint, JivaBlog, JivaPhoto, some games, etc.. - but you can modify/create others if you need. For Miva Merchant users, Jiva Desktop is like a back-office and the front-office is what the app is allowed to do on this side (like JivaBlog, it will install ... a blog)

<h2>What are the 2 Jiva folders?</h2>

Jiva is the folder with the .mvc files. If you want to install Jiva Desktop on your server, you only need this one. Jiva-src is the source, so you can hack, copy, use and do whatever you want with it ( by the terms of the licence of course - that means, you can use it, modify it, but you cannot resell Jiva Desktop and you cannot re-brand it and publish it. You will be able to sell your own apps. if you create some...)

<h2>License</h2>

I'm working on the license but for the moment the license is the following:

<strong>You can use it, modify it, but you cannot resell Jiva Desktop (or any core apps) and you cannot re-brand it and/or publish it.</strong> The goal here is to create a community with one big/bugs-free/working community webapp. If everyone is taking this work and use it individually to make money, it will destroy the whole purpose of the project. Thanks in advance for being honest ;-)

<h2>Why the repository is empty ?</h2>

I'm trying to clean-up the mess first and I'll commit the first version very soon
