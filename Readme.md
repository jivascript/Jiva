Jiva is a Miva Script / Javascript Framework
=============================================

The purpose of this framework is to allow a better and bug-free programming of web applications. Knowlege of Miva Script is a must but knowlege of Javascript is optionnal, unless you want to develop new core objects.

<h2>How this works</h2>

MivaScript is server side and Javascript is client side. So, basically, the main page is created by Mivascript and the rest of the actions on the page is done by Javascript (to make it easier, we work with JQuery). So, this way, we can provide an interactive level on the page after it is loaded - or event before - (things that we could not do only with Mivascript as the file needs to be read and executed by Empresa in order to show the content to the browser). Now with Jiva we can specify actions before and after the page was loaded.

<h2>Why the repository is empty ?</h2>

I'm trying to clean-up the mess first and I'll commit the first version very soon
